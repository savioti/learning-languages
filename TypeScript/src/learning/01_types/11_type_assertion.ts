// Asserting types in TypeScript

// casting a variable of type unknown to a specific type
let someValue: unknown;

someValue = "This is a string assigned to unknown type";

// Type assertion using 'as' syntax
let strLength1: number = (someValue as string).length;
console.log(`Length of string (using 'as' syntax): ${strLength1}`);

someValue = 42;
// The following line would cause a runtime error if uncommented, 
// because we are asserting that someValue is a string when it is actually a number.
let strLength3: number = (someValue as string).length;
console.log(`Length of string (incorrect assertion): ${strLength3}`);

// Checking first before asserting

    console.log(`Length of string (after type check): ${strLength4}`);
